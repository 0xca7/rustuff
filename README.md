# rustuff - rust stuff

This is a collection of mini projects I did in rust that may be of interest to someone else. Will be updated as I code more stuff.

### Current:

- `stm32f4-temp-measure`: contactless temperature measurement using a STM32F401RE Discovery Board and a Melexis MLX90614 temperature sensor with live plot.
